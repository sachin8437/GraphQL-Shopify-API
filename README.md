# GraphQL-Shopify-API
When Tally.so Form submitted then create product in Shopify with fill the value in meta fields.

Client requirements :: 
 I want people to add products to the site will be through a talls.so form where they enter the product details and personal (Sellers) details. and with Zapier the form answers will be creating a new product in Shopify, and create a new user customer account.

Now Zapier has available a default Zap that does that. creates a Shopify product and also creates a new user.

but in order to have better control, I want to have Zapier connect to Shopify Custom fields as well which isn't in the Ready Zap.

So I want to know if its possible to customize or build a custom Zap hat connects to the API and is able to connect to the Shopify custom fields as well.

My solution :: I have solve the problem using API custom code.
